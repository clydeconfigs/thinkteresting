title: a real guide to passwords
---
we always get comments like "do a strong password", but never "do this and that", so here is that guide:

1) **DO NOT** use entire words like "cow", "frederick", "water". NEVER, this is the first rule for passwords. this strings of words are so predictable you wouldn't imagine. if you are going to use words, use a long passphrase, with more than 6 words in it, like "water horse windmill buddha gel snail paperback", preferably with uncommon or misspelled words
2) **DO NOT** use things you like, know, or are a part of your life. an attacker will always put EVERYTHING you know into a dictionary, and take advantage over that. if you like Britney Spears, don't include her in your password, in any way that isn't completely misspelled, like "br.tspr", and that's very, very weak too
3) **DO NOT** use short passwords: this should be the first point, because of it's importance, but for humans to understand, i'll put it in the third point, since it's kinda better you know the previous points before this one, but don't forget length is the PARAMOUNT part of a password. a password you invented and is not totally random, should **_AT ABSOLUTE MINIMUM_** be 12 characters long, and as i said, 6 words long if a passphrase. if you are using predictable words like "br.tspr" for Britney Spears, it maybe should be longer than 12.
