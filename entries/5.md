title: irc; images are not bloat
---

i always dream of a decentralized, unbloated and open source discord, that i can use to store stuff, talk with people and other many things

the era of reading books is over, as is the era of talking with people only using text (like in irc)

we NEED to use images to communicate (at least in the social sense), and we are far away from getting that, without something like discord, skype of, god forbid, google+ *(R.I.P., bro)*

how? just TAKE IRC and PUT IMAGES TO IT! that easy!

IRC is the simplest protocol there is, not bloated pieces of horsecrap like xmpp (god forbid)

just... take that and put images over it, video, gifs and audios... whatever... it's so easy!

```
MARY: hello!
JOE: hello!
MARY: \funny_cat_gif(www.images.org/cat.gif)
```

you don't need a big stupid interface to do that... just interpret that into an image, or a gif, or whatever

voil√†... or something
