title: the fact that some people may be not really known by anyone

if you were to ask people in real life about this people, is there anyone who would tell you like: "oh, yeah! of course, i know them!"

maybe not everyone, of course, but... is there really ANY person who knows these guys *REALLY?* and that they are not a ficticious character from the matrix?
